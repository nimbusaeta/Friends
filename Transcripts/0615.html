first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616.
Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that&#146;s why there is no episode

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Ross) <b>What</b> is the matter with you?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! Barry and Mindy.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel)
Who-who&#146;s Barry and Mindy?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best
friend.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh-oh, wasn&#146;t he cheating on you with her?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her
instead of me.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Why did they get divorced?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else.
Isn&#146;t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean
how different would my life be?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I know what you mean, I&#146;ve always wondered how different my life
would be if-if I&#146;d never gotten divorced.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Which time?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn&#146;t realized she
was a lesbian.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (starts to imagine it) I can&#146;t. I keep seeing it the good way.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> I&#146;d bet I&#146;d still be doing my kara-tay. (That&#146;s karate,
he&#146;s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of
kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y&#146;know, not doing anything else
physical.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn&#146;t be
dating me, that&#146;s for sure.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Sure I would!</p>

<p><strong>All: </strong>(simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What, you guys really think that I&#146;m that shallow?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, I just think Monica was that fat.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, imagine if I never got fired off <i>Days Of Our Lives</i>! (Closes
his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there&#146;s Carol again!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I&#146;d probably be
writing for the <i>New Yorker</i>, getting paid to be funny. But my job&#146;s fun too! I
mean tomorrow, I-I don&#146;t have to wear a tie.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What if I had taken that job at <i>Merrill Lynch</i>?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> <i>Merrill Lynch</i>?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a
knack for stocks.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Well why didn&#146;t you take the job?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true.
So I thought y&#146;know that if I&#146;d work with stocks, I&#146;d have to live in a
box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we&#146;d still
hang out?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>{Transcriber&#146;s note: This is where the opening credits are, but they&#146;re not
the usual opening credits. <b>Oh no</b>! These credits are based on the world that would
have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them
at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the
couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel&#146;s still a
shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating
a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then
they&#146;re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a
groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling
asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And
finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp
and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this
is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn&#146;t apply, for
instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years
in this world.}</p>

<p>[Scene: A newsstand, Ross is buying a magazine and gets in line behind a woman.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (gasps) Rob Tillman!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No-no. It&#146;s-it&#146;s me, Ross!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I&#146;m sorry. Ross Tillman.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no-no, Ross Geller.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, of course Monica&#146;s brother!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Right.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! How are you?!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Good-good, I&#146;m-I&#146;m married. (Shows her his ring.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Me too!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Is-isn&#146;t it the best?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, it&#146;s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of
marriage.) So, umm how&#146;s Monica?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she&#146;s right down the
street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, I would love too.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah? Oh-oh, she&#146;d be so excited!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh! Okay!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on! (They start to leave.)</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh wait, don&#146;t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine)
Busty Ladies?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> No, it&#146;s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I
don&#146;t&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> But! Don&#146;t you have to give him his money back?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here
you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let&#146;s go see Monica!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Fat Monica, and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch.
Monica&#146;s boyfriend is getting up to get something. For future reference, for the rest
of this episode Monica&#146;s fat, I won&#146;t be calling her Fat Monica throughout.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> He&#146;s not boring! He&#146;s just-he&#146;s just low key.</p>

<p><b>Monica's Boyfriend:</b> (returning) Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte. (Hands it to
Monica and sits down.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Thanks.</p>

<p><b>Monica's Boyfriend:</b> Yeah. Y&#146;know, the hazelnut actually not a nut,
it&#146;s a seed.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (not impressed) Wow!!</p>

<p><b>Monica's Boyfriend:</b> Can anyone else name a well known seed that&#146;s been
masquerading as a nut?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, depressed) Hey.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh no! What&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was
funny, just not &quot;<i>Archie</i> Comic funny.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Monica's Boyfriend:</b> Y&#146;know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica's Boyfriend:</b> (kisses her) Okay.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Bye.</p>

<p><b>Monica's Boyfriend:</b> Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer
is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Was his question what&#146;s more boring than him?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey man, look sorry about that <i>Archie</i> thing. Do uh, do you need me
to give you some money?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Really?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ehh.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Maybe Joey doesn&#146;t have to give you the money, TV stars have
assistants right?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant,
would-would you take money from her?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of
your fan mail and stuff!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> That&#146;s great! That would be great! Let&#146;s do that!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I could use the money; it could give me time to write.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh right great! Welcome aboard!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don&#146;t need
any assistance in there, take a break!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right!</p>

<p>(As Joey goes to the bathroom, Corporate Phoebe enters. She&#146;s wearing a business
suit and carrying a briefcase.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey Phoebe! Guess what?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohh that&#146;s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly
grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the
cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it
hits 50! 5-0, it&#146;s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it&#146;s okay. It&#146;s okay,
you&#146;re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.</p>

<p>(She hangs up as Ross and Rachel enter.)</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey Mon! </p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that
her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug,
which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She&#146;s not quite sure of that
one.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> And that&#146;s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hi!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we&#146;ve seen
each other?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon&#146;s
party. I played you one of my songs, y&#146;know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah. Right. So now, are&#151;do you, do you still do music?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!
I&#146;ll play you one of my other&#133;</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from <i>Days
of Our Lives</i>, just walked in here!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Rach, he&#146;s a friend of ours.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well it&#146;s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy
schedule and the fact that he&#146;s not real.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> (To Rachel) Hey-hey, <b>or</b> I could bring my keyboard over here
sometime!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> He&#146;s coming over! He&#146;s coming over!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (getting up) Joey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (holding a plate of what looks like <i>Rice Crispies Treats</i>) I know,
here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High
School together.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (giggles and can&#146;t look at him) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (shaking Rachel&#146;s hand) Hi!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I
watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even
though she tired to kill you&#133;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, it&#146;s always nice to meet the fans.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ah!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (turning and whispering to Monica) She&#146;s not crazy is she?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Rachel) So uh, how you doin&#146;?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Phoebe's, Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe are there. Phoebe&#146;s cell
phone rings and she goes through her little routine of lighting a cigarette before
answering the phone.]</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who&#146;s this?
(Listens) Oh okay, you&#146;re gonna like working for me. What&#146;s your name? (Listens)
What kind of name is Brendy? I&#133; Whatever&#133; Stop talking! All right, from now on
your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey there you are!</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Uh-oh, it&#146;s my boss!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, here&#146;s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this
going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I&#146;m
delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins.
Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (laughs) You realize what you are don&#146;t you?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> You&#146;re his bitch.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (yelling from Monica&#146;s room) No-no!! No!!</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> (panicked) Oh wait! You didn&#146;t just sit on my <i>Kit-Kats </i>did
you?!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13
million dollars.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> But the <i>Kit-Kats</i> are all right?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can&#146;t call my office
they&#146;ll kill me! I can&#146;t call my clients they&#146;ll kill themselves! Great,
now my chest hearts.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> What?!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can&#146;t breathe.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! </p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left
arm?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yes!!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Then yes that is what I&#146;m having. (Takes another puff of the
cigarette.)</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: A hospital, Phoebe is recovering from her heart attack as Ross, Monica, and
Chandler are there to comfort and support her.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Come on Pheebs, it&#146;s not that bad! Y&#146;know most people would be
excited if they didn&#146;t have to work for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Most people don&#146;t like their jobs, I <b>love</b> my job! I have not
been working for three hours and I&#146;m already going crazy. I miss Joan.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Honey, having a heart attack is nature&#146;s way of telling you to slow
it down.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I always thought having a heart attack was nature&#146;s way of
telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you&#146;re not gonna die. I mean, you are
<b>going</b> to die, but you&#146;re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Let&#146;s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y&#146;know maybe you
should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> (To Ross) So what&#146;s going on with you?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well umm, I&#146;ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Still going through that dry spell with Carol?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> How long has it been since you had sex?</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, last weekend&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh that&#146;s not so bad.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#133;will be two months&#133;</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> That is.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> &#133;since I stopped trying.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Maybe you need to spice things up a little.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> What-what do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> I don&#146;t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could
eat stuff off each other&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Y&#146;know, dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys&#133;</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Wow!</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Roll playing&#133; You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner.
You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Okay, I think I got it.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and
you&#146;re-you&#146;re-you&#146;re rolling around naked on the trading floor and
everybody&#146;s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.</p>

<p>[Scene: A hospital hallway, Chandler is sitting on a gurney with his hands spread out
behind his back. Then Monica comes and plops down on the gurney and one of his hands.
Chandler immediately recoils in extreme pain.]</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Sorry. So how&#146;s it going with Joey?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, &quot;Bring me
food.&quot; Two is, &quot;I&#146;m with a girl, bring us food.&quot; Three is,
&quot;I&#146;m lost and I can&#146;t find food.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?</p>

<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah! She&#146;s right in there! (Points to Phoebe&#146;s room.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants,
they look ready!</p>

<p>[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Joey is showing Rachel around the set.]</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All right, and over there is Brady&#146;s Pub where I like to unwind after
a long day of surgeoning.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, <b>that</b> is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a
large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh <b>that</b> is an old
man! Hey old man!</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hey!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Wow! Umm, y&#146;know, I-I would really love to, but I-I
shouldn&#146;t.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Why? (In Drake&#146;s voice.) Why can&#146;t the world stop turning, just
for a moment? Just for us?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (awestruck, then not) Isn&#146;t that a line from the show?!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake&#146;s voice) I may have said those things
before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> That&#146;s a line from the show too!</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, you watch too much TV.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> (approaching) Here you go Joe, here&#146;s the freshly squeezed orange
juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there&#146;s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> I thought we talked about this. I don&#146;t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp
isn&#146;t juice. All juice, okay?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> I&#146;m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh my God, I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.)
Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Iced tea.</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, anything for you sir?</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?</p>

<p><b>Rachel:</b> (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.</p>

<p><b>Joey:</b> (To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth
indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares
at him.) You&#146;re gonna throw that juice at me, aren&#146;t ya?</p>

<p><b>Chandler:</b> It&#146;s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Carol's, Ross is trying to talk to Carol about what Phoebe told him.]</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower
there.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.</p>

<p><b>Ross:</b> Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things
up a little.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> What do you mean?</p>

we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a
threesome.</p>

<p><b>Carol:</b> (quickly) I love that idea!</p>
