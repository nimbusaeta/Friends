Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy
I work with!
Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's
gotta be something wrong with him!
Chandler: All right Joey, be
nice  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?
Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl- oh!
Monica: Okay, everybody relax This is not even a
date It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex
Chandler: Sounds like a date to me
Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm
standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked
All: Oh, yeah Had that dream
Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a
phone there
Joey: Instead of?
Chandler: That's right
Joey: Never had that dream
Phoebe: No
Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring
Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me 
Monica: And they weren't looking at
you before?!
Chandler: Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother,
which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Ross:  Hi
Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself
Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?
Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my
throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my
neck
Chandler: Cookie?
Monica:  Carol moved her
stuff out today 
Joey: Ohh
Monica:  Let me get you some coffee
Ross: Thanks
Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! 
Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just
leave my aura alone, okay?
Phoebe: Fine!  Be murky!
Ross: I'll be fine,
alright? Really, everyone I hope she'll be very happy
Monica: No you don't
Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian
Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on
that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian 
 Did I say that out loud?
Ross: I told mom and dad last night,
they seemed to take it pretty well
Monica: Oh really, so that
hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 AM, "I'll never have
grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren" was what?  A wrong number?
Ross: Sorry
Joey: Alright Ross, look You're feeling a lot of
pain right now You're angry You're hurting Can I tell you what the answer is?
Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some
hormones!
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just I
just- I just wanna be married again!
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! 
Monica: Rachel?!
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to
your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be
here and you are, you are!
Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?
Monica:  De-caff  Okay,
everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor  This is everybody,
this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? 
Rachel: Hi, sure!
Ross: Hi 
back down defeated again  A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others
Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting
for four wet bridesmaids?
Rachel: Oh God well, it started about a half hour
before the wedding I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was
looking at this gravy boat This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat When all of a sudden-
Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned
on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it
hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr Potato Head Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked
familiar, but Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I
doing this, and who am I doing this for?'  So anyway I just didn't know where
to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I
knew who lived here in the city
Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding
Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an
issue 
Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big
pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it 
Chandler: 
Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Ross:  I'll have
whatever Christine is having
Rachel:  Daddy, I just I can't marry
him! I'm sorry I just don't love him Well, it matters to me! 
Phoebe:  If I let go of
my hair, my head will fall off 
Chandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing
those pants 
Joey: I say push her down the stairs 
Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey: 
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's
like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!' And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a
shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble
Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life Well maybe I'll
just stay here with Monica 
Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's
staying here with Monica
Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision Well, maybe
I don't need your money Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Monica: Just breathe, breathe that's it Just try
to think of nice calm things
Phoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and
kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something
with mittens La la la lasomething and noodles with
string  These are a few
Rachel: I'm all better now
Phoebe: 
 I helped!
Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best,
y'know? Independence Taking control of your life  The whole,
'hat' thing
Joey:  And hey, you need anything,
you can always come to Joey Me and Chandler live across the hall And he's away a lot
Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding
day!
Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?
Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a
horrible sound
Paul:  It's, uh,
it's Paul
Monica: Oh God, is it
6:30?  Buzz him in!
Joey: Who's Paul?
Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Monica: Maybe Joey: Wait Your 'not a real
date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Ross: He finally asked you out?
Monica: Yes!
Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment
Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel
Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Monica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you
want me to stay?
Ross:  That'd be good
Monica:  Really?
Ross:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine
Guy!
Phoebe: What does that mean?  
Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? 
Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is 
 everybody, everybody, this is Paul
All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name Paul,
was it?
Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll
just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah
Ross: A wandering?
Monica: Change!  Okay,
sit down  Two seconds
Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes That
can't be good
Joey:  Hey, Paul!
Paul: Yeah?
Joey: Here's a little tip, she
really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until
it starts to get a little red
Monica: 
Shut up, Joey!
Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh what're you up
to tonight?
Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for
Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon,
God No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year talk about your-  -big
lizards Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are
coming over to help me put together my new furniture
Chandler:  Yes, and we're very excited
about it 
Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just
gonna hang out here tonight  It's been kinda a long day
Ross: Okay, sure
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to
Phoebe:  Love is sweet as
summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your loveis
like a giant pigeoncrapping on my heart  La-la-la-la-la- 
 Thank you  La-la-la-laohhh!
Ross:  I'm
supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm
guys I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs
Joey: I'm thinking we've got a
bookcase here
Chandler: It's a beautiful thing
Joey:  What's this?
Chandler: I would have to
say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket
Joey: Which goes where?
Chandler: I have no
idea
Joey: Done with the bookcase!
Chandler: All finished!
Ross:  This was
Carol's favorite beer She always drank it out of the can, I should have known
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're
gonna start with that stuff we're outta here
Chandler: Yes, please don't spoil
all this fun
Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question She got the
furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Ross: You guys
Chandler: Oh, God
Joey: You got screwed
Chandler: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh my God!
Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot I guess I
should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week I
mean, how clean can teeth get?
Monica: My brother's going through that right now,
he's such a mess How did you get through it?
Paul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers, say her-
Monica: -leg?
Paul:  That's one way! Me, I- I went for
the watch
Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by
boyfriend's favorite bath towel
Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you
Monica: That's right
Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry I am so sorry I know
you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love
with your socks on, but it isn't it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- 
 Hi, machine cut me off again anywaylook,
look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs Barry Finkel,
but it isn't me, it's not me  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but
you just have to give me a chance too 
Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only
26 and I'm divorced!
Joey: Shut up!
Chandler: You must stop! 
Ross: That only took me an hour
Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta
understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento
  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years  
Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and
that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if
there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's
it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her
Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'?
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you Lemme tell you something,
Ross There's lots of flavors out there There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!
Cherry Vanilla You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the
best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?
Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny
Chandler: Stay out of my freezer! 
Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh
Monica: What? What, you wanna spell it out with
noodles?
Paul: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda
revelation
Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Paul: Isn't there?
Monica: Yeah yeah, I think there is -What were
you gonna say?
Paul: Well, ever-ev- ever since she left me, um,
I haven't been able to, uh, perform  Sexually 
Monica:  Oh God, oh
God, I am sorry I am so sorry
Paul: It's okay
Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what
you need right now Um how long?
Paul: Two years
Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Paul: So you still think you, um might want that
fifth date?
Monica: Yeah Yeah, I do
Priest on TV:

Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony
Rachel: Ohsee but Joanne loved Chachi! That's
the difference!
Ross:  Grab a spoon Do you know how long
it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything
to you? 
Joey: Great story!  But, I uh,

buy stuff
Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor

the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the
park
Joey: Look, it was a job all right?
Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy'
Joey: I will not take this abuse 
Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry 
 "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy"
Joey: You should both know,
that he's a dead man  Oh, Chandler?  
Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay?

snap in his turtle for two years 
Joey: Of course it was a line! 
Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? 
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you
into bed' 
Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!
Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't
want to put that out into the universe
Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? 
Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet  
Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know? 
Joey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Rachel: Guess what? 
Ross: You got a job? 
Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve
interviews today 
Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat 
Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty
percent off! 
Chandler: Oh, how well you know me 
Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got
great boots' boots!

Rachel: I know that That's why I was getting married 
Phoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time 
Rachel: Thank you 
Phoebe: You're welcome I remember when I first came to this city I was
fourteen My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got
here, and I didn't know anybody And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,
cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy So believe me, I know exactly how you feel 
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway' 
Monica: All right, you ready?
Rachel: No  No, no, I'm not
ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the
airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!
Monica: You can, I know you
can!

coffee!   You can do anything! 
Ross: C'mon, cut Cut, cut, cut, 
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut

Monica:  Rachel! 
That was a library card! 
All: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
Chandler: 
 Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream 
Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks You're
gonna love it! 
Monica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch? 
Ross: No No, I gotta go home sometime 
Monica: You be okay?

Rachel: Okay 
Ross: Okay  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in
high school, I had a, um, major crush on you 
Rachel: I knew 
Ross: You did! Oh I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother 
Rachel: I did 
Ross: Oh Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime? Maybe? 
Rachel: Yeah, maybe 
Ross: Okay okay, maybe I will 
Rachel: Goodnight 
Ross: Goodnight 
Monica: See ya Waitwait, what's with you?

Phoebe:  What I said you had 
Monica:  Would you stop? 
Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?
All: Yes!
Monica: I said that you had a nice
butt, it's just not a great butt
Joey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great
butt if it came up and bit ya
Ross: There's an image
Rachel:  Would anybody like more coffee?

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us,
kissing is as important as any part of it 
Joey: Yeah, right!Y'serious? 
Phoebe: Oh, yeah! 
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss 
Monica: Absolutely 
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act,
y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd
comes out 
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that
that's not why we bought the ticket 
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great
the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're
in the car, we're fighting traffic basically just trying to stay awake 
Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian Otherwise next time
you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone 
Joey: Are we still talking about sex?
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little
angry? 
Marsha: Well, she has issues 
Ross: Does she 
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits
at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! 
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that
glacier's getting kinda close' See? 
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 
Ross:  No No 
Marsha: Yes, it is Carol! Hi! 
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in
the Ice Age 
Ross:Hi 
Carol: So 
Ross: You look great I, uh I hate that 
Carol: Sorry You look good too 
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who stands erect So what's new? Still,
uh 
Carol: A lesbian? 
Ross: Well you never know How's, um how's the family? 
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid Oh, and, uh- 
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol? 
Carol: I'm pregnant 
Ross: Pregnant?! 
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's
Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding 
Phoebe:Then I've already seen this one!  
Monica:  Are you through with that? 
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down 
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I
realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and 
now I wish I was dead 
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow Monica, you know, you've already
fluffed that-  -but, it's fine! 
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition
than they already have 
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a
child's pillow 
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me I mean, you're like, you're
like all chaotic and twirly And not-not in a good way 
Joey: Yeah, calm down You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every
time they come 
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong
Y'see, he's the Prince Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born 
Chandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 
Monica: What? 
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 
All: Eeaagh! 
Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful 
Rachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God 
Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that! 
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to
him 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front
of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the
ring, which makes it so much harder 
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it  Won't we! 
Chandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days 
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the
kitchen with 
Chandler: Dinah? 
Rachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad 
Monica: You didn't 
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry 
Monica: I gave you one job! 
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring
in a lasagne 
Monica:  I just can't do it 
Chandler: Boys? We're going in 
Ross: Hi 
Monica: Wow That is not a happy hi 
Ross: Carol's pregnant 
Phoebe:  Ooh! I found it! 
Monica: W-w-wh- wha- w-w-w- 
Ross: Yeah Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about
now  
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? 
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not
comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved basically it's entirely up to me 
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her 
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'? 
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done 
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them
tomorrow 
Rachel: So what are you gonna do? 
Ross: I have no idea No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father 
Joey: Well, this is still ruined, right?
Mrs Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you 
Mmm! What's that curry taste? 
Monica: Curry 
Mrs Geller: Mmmm! 
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do 
Mr Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for
you, didn't she? 
Mrs Geller: They all had a thing for him 
Ross: Aw, Mom 
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 
Mrs Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,
or food, or I don't know Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant 
Mrs Geller: Well, they don't have to know that 
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? 
Ross: Yeah  
Mrs Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's easy 
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you
planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some
of the heat off me 
Mrs Geller: What that Rachel did to her life We ran into her parents at the
club, they were not playing very well 
Mr Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty
thousand dollars is a lot of money! 
Mrs Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar 
Monica: What's that supposed to mean? 
Mrs Geller: Nothing! It's an expression 
Monica: No it's not 
Mr Geller: Don't listen to your mother You're independent, and you always have
been! Even when you were a kid and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were
just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles 
Mr Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who
need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published Other
people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer 
Mr Geller: And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank
God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem 
Monica:  So, Ross, what's going on
with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to
share with the folks? 
Ross:  Okay! Okay  Look, I, uh- I realise
you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well,
here's the deal Carol's a lesbian She's living with a woman named Susan She's pregnant
with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby 
Mrs Geller:  And you knew about this?! 
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh? 
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros They know what they're doing, they
take their time, they get the job done 
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents, boy, if you
could-  -I'd want yours 
Ross: Must pee  
Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins 
Rachel: You're twins? 
Phoebe: Yeah We don't speak She's like this high-powered, driven career type 
Chandler: What does she do? 
Phoebe: She's a waitress 
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now 
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this 
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who my parents
actually preferred

Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped' Chances are he's

terrific, I know it'll be hard Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give
Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN

Carol: All right, you two, stop it! 
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too 
Carol: Ross You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I
think that borders on child abuse 
Ross: Of course not, I'm suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch 
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say
all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! 
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever
imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is
too hard I'm not, I can't do-

Susan: Look at that 
Carol: I know 
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing? 
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
Chandler: I dunno, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise 
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it
kinda looks like an old potato 
Ross: Then don't do that, alright? 
Phoebe: Okay! 
Ross: Monica Whaddya think? 
Monica:  Mm-hmm 
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

s01e03
Phoebe:  Hi guys! 
All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi! 
Ross: Hey Oh, oh, how'd it go? 
Phoebe: Um, not so good He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this
again!' 
All: Ohh Ouch 
Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? 
Monica: Uh, no Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will
never see me naked' 
Rachel: Since when? 
Joey: Since always It's like dating language Y'know, like 'It's not you' means
'It is you' 
Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing
alcoholics and complaining about them to you' 
Phoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha,
I already am' 
Rachel: And everybody knows this? 
Joey: Yeah Cushions the blow 
Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to
sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm 
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send
our dog off to live on a farm 
Monica: Uh, Ross 
Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was-
it w- Oh my God, Chi Chi! 
Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" 
Joey: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over But you'll have to
live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die" 
Chandler: Hey, that was really good! 
Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going 
Chandler: Okay "So Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?" 
Joey: "I just wanna go back to my cell 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke" 
Chandler: "Smoke away" 
Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone 
Joey: What? 
Chandler: Relax your hand! 
Chandler: Not so much! 
Joey: Whoah! 
Chandler: Hey! 
Joey: Hey! 
Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff 
Chandler: Alright okay No Give it to me 
Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette 
Chandler: It's fine, it's fine Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here 
Chandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette Think of it as the thing that's been
missing from your hand When you're holding it, you feel right You feel complete 
Joey: Y'miss it? 
Chandler: Nah, not so much Alright, now we smoke  Oh my
God  
Monica: No, no, no They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a
guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger 
Joey: That's ridiculous! 
Ross: Can I use either thumb? 
Rachel:  Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
 Decaf cappucino for Joey Coffee black Late And an iced
tea I'm getting pretty good at this! 
All: Yeah Yeah, excellent 
Rachel:  Good for me! 
Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe? 
Phoebe: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank

Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just- Okay I'm going through my mail, and I open up
their monthly, you know, STATEMENT- 
Ross: Easy 
Phoebe: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account 
Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again 
Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them 
Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it! 
Phoebe: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like
stealing 
Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! 
Phoebe: Okay Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes Do you know
what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine Not-mine Not-mine' And even if I was
happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine,
not-not-mine' 
Monica: We're with you We got it 
Phoebe: Okay I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it It would be like this
giant karmic debt 
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing? 
Monica:  Hey Whaddya doing? 
All: Oh! Oh, God! 
Ross: What is this?! 
Chandler: I'm smoking I'm smoking, I'm smoking 
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
Chandler: And this- is my reward! 
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last
time you quit 
Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit! 
All: Ohhh! Put it out! 
Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out 
Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now! 
Monica: Alright I'm gonna go change, I've got a date

Monica: No Not after what happened with Steve 
Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!
Sorry 
Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet Just give me a chance
to figure that out 
Rachel: Well, then can we meet him? 
Monica: Nope Schhorry 
Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and
within five minutes they're all over him I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the
weak members of the herd 
Paula: Listen As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll
tell you: that is not such a terrible thing I mean, they're your friends, they're just
looking out after you 
Monica: I know I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually
liked 
Paula: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if
they never get to meet the guy 
Joey: Let it go, Ross 
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi 
Monica: Do you all promise? 
All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! 
Monica:  Chandler? Do you promise to be good? 
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! 
Ross: Hey, Pheebs 
Phoebe: 'Dear Ms Buffay Thank you for calling attention to our error We have
credited your account with five hundred dollars We're sorry for the inconvenience, and
hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift'
Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! 
Rachel: What bank is this? 
Monica: Hey It's him  Who is it? 
Alan:  It's Alan 
Joey:  Chandler! He's here! 
Monica:  Okay, please be good, please Just remember how much you

Monica: C'mon! 
Ross: I'll go Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I
can't do this, can't do this We loved him 
All: Loved him! Yeah! He's great! 
Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out
with? 
All: Yeah! 
Rachel: And did you notice?  
The Guys:  Yeah 
Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked 
Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe! 
Ross: What shoe? 
Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked
smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a while' 
Ross: So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future
boyfriends will be measured 
Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it 
Monica: Really! 
Chandler: Oh, yeah I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone
You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  
Ross: You know what I like most about him, though? 
All: What? 
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself 
All: Yeah 
Monica: Hi how was the game? 
Ross: Well 
All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! 
Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? 
Joey: Alan 
Ross: He was unbelievable He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where
Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base- 
Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team 
Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about
softball 
Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe
sometimes 
Ross: What? 
Monica: I dunno, a little too Alan? 
Rachel: Well, no That's impossible You can never be too Alan 
Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore 
Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan 
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie 
Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl 
Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup 
Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels? 
Phoebe: Yes But I left in the Ys 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y" Uh,
I also have something else for you  
Lizzie: Saltines? 
Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? 
Lizzie: What?  Oh my God, there's
really money in here 
Phoebe: I know 
Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing? 
Phoebe: No, I want you to have it I don't want it 
Lizzie: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something 
Phoebe: Oh, that's fine, no

Lizzie: Okay 
Phoebe: Okay 
of a cigarette, sprays around some air freshener, and takes some breath spray  He
types for a little while, opens the drawer again, and takes another drag of the cigarette
  While not paying attention, he sprays the breath spray around the room, takes a
Lizzie: Keep the change  Sure you don't wanna pretzel? 
Phoebe: No, I'm fine 
Lizzie:  See ya 
Phoebe: Huh! 
Ross: A thumb?! 
All: Eww! 
Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? 
Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see? 
All: Nooo! 
All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out! 
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb! 
Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair! 
Monica: Oh, why is it unfair? 
Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with
that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? I accept all those
flaws, why can't you accept me for this? 
Joey: Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? 
Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it 
Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her
hair? 
Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing 
Joey: Oh,  "you do, do you"? 
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly 
Rachel: "Indeed there isn't" I should really get back to work 
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered 
Rachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh The hair comes out, and the gloves come on 
Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? 
Paula: No 
Monica: Okay Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like 
Paula: Waitwait we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got
through! 
Monica: Can you believe it? Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing
I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing 
Paula: Honey you should always feel the thing Listen, if that's how
you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! 
Monica: I know it's gonna be really hard 
Paula: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it 
Monica: No, he'll be fine It's the other five I'm worried about 
Joey: Do you have any respect for your body? 
Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your
emphysema and your heart disease The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it 
Rachel:  Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to
speak to you 
Chandler: Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she
told you about that, huh Well, yeah, I have one now and then Well, yeah, now Well, it's
not that big- well, that's true, Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that
before Well, okay, thanks!  
Rachel:  God, he's good 
Ross: If only he were a woman 
Rachel: Yeah 
Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too 
Ross: Okay I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch  
Monica:  Hey Where's Joey? 
Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him Do you think that was
wrong? 
Rachel: I think he's across the hall 
Monica: Thanks  
Ross:  There y'go 
Chandler:  Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now 
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart? Pheebs? 
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? 
Ross: Hey, I might! 
Phoebe: Sorry Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars
for the thumb 
All: You're kidding Oh my God 
Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum What is up with the
universe?! 
Joey:  What's going
on? 
Monica: Nothing I just think it's nice when we're all here together 
Joey: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear 
Rachel: Uh, Joey 
Joey: Oh, God!  
Monica:  Okay 
All: Oh! That was Lambchop! 
Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk 
Phoebe: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vuno, I'm not

Ross: Is there somebody else? 
Monica: No, nononono it's just things change People change 
Rachel: We didn't change 
Joey: So that's it? It's over? Just like that? 
Phoebe: You know you let your guard down, you start to really care about
someone, and I just- I-  
Monica: Look, I- I could go on pretending- 
Joey: Okay! 
Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It
wouldn't be fair to you! 
Ross: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back Y'know, the way they
were 
Monica: I'm sorry 
Chandler:  Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! 
Rachel:  I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming

Monica: Relieved? 
Alan: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you I just can't stand your friends
Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats? That was fun 
Ross: Yeah He could row like a viking 
Monica:  Hi 
All: Mmm

everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? 
Monica:  Uh- Rachel has
left the building, can you call back? 
Rachel: Alright, c'mon!  Let's play Twister!
Ross:  Sorry, sorry Uh-oh
Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with

night It was the first frost 
Joey: C'mon, sit Just sit down, sit 
Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're

Phoebe: You are just like Jack 
Rachel: Jack from downstairs? 
Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk 
Monica: Ah, the other Jack

then he got those magic beans And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village 
Rachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-

Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word 
Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it

window- and her face had the most incredible glow 
Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? 
Joey: He's right, enough, already What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that 
Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated 
Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?

Never-never mind 
Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! 
Rachel:  Ohhh I'm fine
s01e05
Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing Ok, you just reach in there, there's
one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve All right, as far as I'm
concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close Am I right?
Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up
Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that
Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want
You just look down and there they are How you get any work done is beyond me
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean
things, and then not even care
Ross: Multiple orgasms!
Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!
Joey: No plans, huh?
Chandler: Not a one
Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up
Monica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone You just gotta do it
Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting
there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage
to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note
Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling 
Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you
Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her 
Phoebe: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony 
Ross: Tony?
Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I
don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know
Rachel:  Does anybody want anything else?
Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey
pie thing  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine
Phoebe:  What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Rachel: It's my father He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible
Ross: That guy, he burns me up
Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home Oh, it was horrible He
called me young lady
Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that
Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing
again?
Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three
choruses of "You'll never make it on your own"
Phoebe:  Uh-huh, uh-huh
Angela: Hi, Joey
Joey: My god, Angela
Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her
Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?
Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet I don't wanna seem too eager One
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi That seems pretty cool 
 Hey, Angela 
Angela:  Joey
Joey: You look good
Angela: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs
Joey: You don't say
Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Rachel: Oh, big glamour night Me and Monica at Laundorama
Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry
there too?
Rachel: Who?
Ross: Me Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you
both, here?
Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a rat
problem Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but
they're comin' out all fluffy Anyway, say, sevenish?
Rachel: Sure
Angela: Forget it Joey I'm with Bob now
Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Angela: Bob is great He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job
You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob
Joey: Come on, we were great together And not just at the fun stuff, but like,
talking too
Angela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Joey: What?
Angela: We're just friends
Joey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together
tonight? You know, as friends?
Angela: What four of us?
Joey: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica
as his girlfriend His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take

Joey: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here If I do this for her brother, maybe
Angela will come back to me
Monica: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls
Joey:  I know, but, I made a huge mistake I never should have broken up
with her Will you help me? Please?
Ross:  Ok, bye  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna
be me and Rachel
Chandler: Oh Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing
through?
Ross: It's laundry The thinking through is minimal
Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date You're
going on a date
Ross: Nuh-uh
Chandler: Yuh-huh
Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear This is basically the
first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
Ross:  No
Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ross: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a
sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear Ok, I can pick something
else up on the way
Chandler: There you go
Monica: Thank you So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Joey: Yep
Monica: Which?
Joey: Which what?

Chandler: Hey, Janice
Janice: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me I had the most supremely awful

Janice: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the

Chandler: What?
Janice: What?
Chandler:  What did you get me there? 
Janice: I got youthese

moose and squirrel Whatever you want
Chandler: That's great 
Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso Can I get you another latte?

youOh, hey, uh you must need detergent
Rachel: What's that?
Ross: Uberveiss It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough
Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Rachel: Oh god Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed
to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? 
Ross: Rach, have you never done this before?
Rachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have Ok, you caught me
I'm a laundry virgin
Ross: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle Ok, um, basically you
wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third
for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things
Rachel:  Ok, Well, what about these

do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do

Chandler: Here goes 
Aurora: Yes?
Chandler: Hi um okay, next word would be Chandler! Chandler is my
name, and, uhhi
Aurora: Yes, you said that

what I wanted to say was, uh would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou,
goodnight  
Aurora: Chandler?
All: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey: Whadja think?
All: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Joey: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad It was better than that thing I did
with the trolls, at least you got to see my head
All:  Saw your head Saw your head
Chandler:  She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play,
man Whoah  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name
'Chand-lrr' 'Chand-lrr' I think I like it better that way  Oh, listen, the
usher gave me this to give to you 
Rachel: What is it?
Joey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe
they wanna sign me!
Phoebe: Based on this play? Based on this play!
Chandler: Hey, kids 
All: Hey
Phoebe:  No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is
just a line
Chandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you
haven't asked me how my date went
Monica: Oh, right, right How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Chandler: It was unbelievable I-I've never met anyone like her She's had the
most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army
Aurora: Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block So, we made it
to the border, but just barely, and I- I've been talking about myself all night long,
I'm sorry What about you? Tell me one of your stories
Chandler: Alright Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I
rode it all the way to Brooklyn just for the hell of it
Chandler: We talked 'til like two It was this perfect evening more or
less
Aurora: All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon 
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Aurora: 'We' would be me and Rick
Joey: Who's Rick?
Chandler: Who's Rick?
Aurora: My husband
All: Ooooohhh
Chandler: Oh, so you're divorced?
Aurora: No
Chandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?Hopefully?
Aurora: No, I'm still married
Chandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you
sitting here with me?Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change
in my pocket?
Aurora: Don't worry I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay
with Ethan
Chandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Aurora: Mmmm Ethan is my boyfriend
All: What?!
Chandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do
you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Aurora: I suppose mainly sexual
Chandler: Hm
Monica: Oh I'm sorry it didn't work out
Chandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday Didn't you
listen to the story?
Monica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you
get involved with a woman like this?
Chandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I
look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none
of the responsibility I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
Phoebe: Oh, yeah That is not true Ross, is this your fantasy?
Ross: No, of course not!  Yeah, yeah, it is
Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out
with someone else?
Joey: I couldn't do it
Monica: Good for you, Joey
Joey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with
more people than she is
Ross: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept I mean,
anthropologically speaking-
Ross: Fine Fine, alright, now you'll never know
Monica: We're kidding C'mon, tell us!
All: Yeah! C'mon!
Ross: Alright There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Rachel: Tah-daaah!
Chandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that
Rachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors I even used all
the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't
know what that's for
Ross: Oh yeah, nobody knows And we're not supposed to ask
Rachel: Well, whaddya think?
All: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Monica: Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman
All: Uh-oh
Monica: How-how did that happen?
Rachel: I dunno I-I thought it looked better there And I- and also, it's an
extra seat around the coffee table
Monica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see
what it looked like in the old spot  Alright, just to compare Let's see
Well, it looks good there too Let's just leave it there for a while
Phoebe:  I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman
Chandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines I mean, she'll
scratch your eyes right out
Monica: You guys, I am not that bad!
Phoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a
little, y'know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Monica: That is so unfair!
Ross: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that
wasn't raggedy!
Monica: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised But hey, I can be a kook
Ross: Alright, you madcap gal Try to imagine this The phone bill arrives, but
you don't pay it right away
Monica: Why not?
Ross: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice
Monica: I could do that
Rachel: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent,
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout
Monica: Why would someone do that?! One might wonder
Chandler: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table There's no coaster It's a
cold drink, it's a hot day Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and
closer to the surface of the wood
Monica: STOP IT!! Oh my God It's true! Who am I?
Ross: Monica? You're Mom
Phoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Joey:  Uh huh uh huh oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! 
 That was my agent  My agent has
just gotten me a jobin the new Al Pacino movie!
All: Oh my God! Whoah!
Monica: Well, what's the part?
Joey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor!
"I'm out of order? Pfeeeh You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of
order!"
Phoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?
Joey: "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"
Ross: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?

Joey: C'mon, you guys This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's
big!
Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's it's y'know, you deserve this, after
all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into
showbusiness
Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Ross: You're right, you're right, it isSo you gonna invite us all to the big
opening?
Monica: Alright, alright, alright 
Joey: Here I need to borrow some moisturizer

Chandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone
Monica: He's in the bathroom I don't think you wanna go in there!
Chandler: C'mon, we're roommates!

Monica: I warned you
Rachel: Who is being loud?
Chandler: Oh, that would be Monica Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things,
Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast
Monica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Chandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know 
Rachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Chandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it 'Kay? Y'know in a
relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your
life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora and I've just wasted about
thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh Monica, can you help me with the door?
Monica: Sure Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind
you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brushBut I'm not gonna do that 
Director: Dammit, hire the girl! 
Okay, everybody ready?
Joey: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity
Director: Lose the robe

Director: And cut Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?
Joey: Well, I'm- I'm showering
Director: No, that was clenching
Joey: Oh Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his
wife's dead, his brother's missing I think his butt would be angry here
Director: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch Once again,
rolling water working and actionand cut What was that?
Joey: I was going for quiet desperation But if you have to ask
Chandler: God, I love these fingers
Aurora: Thank you
Chandler: No, actually I meant my fingers Look at 'em, look at how happy they
are
Aurora:  Oh my God, I'm late 
Chandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go 
Aurora: Okay

Aurora: Okay Oh no, I have to
Chandler:  Too bad, she's leaving
Aurora:  I'm sorry He'll be waiting for me
Chandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick
Aurora: It's not Rick
Chandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Aurora: No, it's-it's Andrew 
Chandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret
asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
Aurora: He's new
Chandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick,
Ethan and myself?
Aurora: No, that's not exactly what I was
Chandler: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us
Aurora: So what do you want?
Chandler: You
Aurora: You have me!
Chandler: Nono, just you
Aurora: Whaddyou mean?
Chandler: Lose the other guys
Aurora: Like, all of them?
Chandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Aurora: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and
laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another and up until tonight I
thought that's what you wanted too
Chandler: Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys,
y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy
Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out!
Get out!'
Aurora: So which one of the two guys will you listen to?
Chandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly
let each other finish
Aurora: Which one?
Chandler: The second guy
Aurora:  Well, call me if you change your mind
Chandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips
Ross: Look at it this way: you dumped her
Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable Tell me why you did this again?
All: Hey!
Monica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al
Pacino movie?
Joey: Nope
Ross: No? What happened, big guy?
Chandler:  "Big guy?"
Ross: It felt like a 'big guy' moment
Joey: I got fired
All: Oh!
Joey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it I told everybody about this! Now
everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and
Rachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell
Joey: My mom will
Chandler: Something so sweet anddisturbing about that
Joey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years And I finally
get my shot, and I blow it!
Monica: Maybe this wasn't your shot
Ross: Yeah, I mean I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's
your shot Did it feel like your shot?
Joey: Hard to tell, I was naked
Phoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot I mean, I don't even think you
just get one shot I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've
gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go
'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'
Joey: Yeah? That's so nice! 
Monica: I'm sorry, Joey I'm gonna go to bed, guys 
All: Night
Rachel: Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Monica:  Uh-huh!
Rachel: Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Monica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow Or not Whenever 
Ross: She is a kook
Monica:  If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes No Don't do this This is stupid! I don't have
to prove anything, I'm gonna go get themBut then everyone will know Unless I get them,
and then wake up really early and put them back! I need help!

floor of the New York CIty public library
Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Ross: Pheebs, what about you?
Phoebe: Oh Milwaukee
Rachel: Um Ross?
Ross: Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All'
All: No way!
Ross: The ride broke down So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those
mechanical Dutch children then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel
Rachel: Oh come on, I already went
Monica: You did not go!
All: Come on
Rachel: Oh, alright The weirdest place would have to be  oh, the
foot of the bed 
Ross: Step back
Joey: We have a winner!
Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know,
where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park
Ross: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line
Rachel: There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf
course 
Ross: Come on
Rachel: No, he said we were holding up the people behind us
Ross:  And you didn't marry him because?
Rachel: I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having
that kind of
Ross: Probably But you know, I'll tell you something Passion is way overrated
Rachel: Yeah right
Ross: It is Eventually, it kind of burns out But hopefully, what you're
left with is trust, and security, and well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism So,
you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion thing, there's all that
other good stuff
Rachel:  OK
Ross: But, um I don't think that's going to be you
Rachel: You don't
Ross: Uh-uh See, I see big passion in your future
Rachel: Really?
Ross: Mmmm
Rachel: You do?
Ross: I do
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great 
Joey: It's never gonna happen
Ross:  What?
Joey: You and Rachel
Ross:  What?  Why not?
Joey: Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend
zone 
Ross: No, no, no I'm not in the zone
Joey: Ross, you're mayor of the zone
Ross: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork Yeah I mean,
every day I get just a little bit closer to
Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're
thinking If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever
Ross: I will, I will See, I'm waiting for the right moment 
What? What, now?
Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight?
You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that' 
Ross: Shhhh!
Rachel: What are you shushing?
Ross: We're shushing because we're trying to hear something Listen
 Don't you hear that?
Rachel: Ahhhh!
Ross: See?
Rachel: Huh 
Jill: Would you like some gum?
Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?
Jill:  Sorry, it's not
Chandler: Oh, then no thanks What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill
Goodacre offers you gum, you take it If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take
it
Phoebe:  New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour But
to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy la la la, la la, la la 
Ross:  OK, here goes
Joey: Are you going to do it?

Joey: Good luck, man
Ross: Thanks  OK
Joey: OK 
Joey: Hey, where are you going?
Monica: Outside
Joey: You can't go out there
Monica: Why not?
Joey: Because of the reason
Monica: And that would be?
Joey: I, um, can't tell you
Monica: Joey, what's going on?
Joey: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told
you
Monica: About what?
Joey: He's planning your birthday party
Monica: Oh my God! I love him!
Joey:  You'd better act surprised
Phoebe: About what?
Monica: My surprise party!
Phoebe: What surprise party?
Monica: Oh stop it Joey already told me
Phoebe: Well, he didn't tell me
Joey: Hey, don't look at me This is Ross's thing
Phoebe: This is so typical I'm always the last one to know everything
Monica: No, you are not We tell you stuff
Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the
peacock at the zoo I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was
moving in  Looks
like I was second to last
Rachel: Hmmm this is so nice
Ross: OK, I have a question Well, actually, it's not so much a question as
more of a general wondering ment
Rachel: OK
Ross: OK Here goes For a while now, I've been wanting to, um
Rachel: Ohhh!!!! 
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right
Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat!

looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found
ever since
Monica:  This is just Bactine It won't hurt
Joey: Sorry, that was wax
Phoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death We should find his owner
Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Ross:  Yeah?
Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection 
 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be
perfection' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no,
no For me, gum is perfection I loathe myself
Phoebe:  Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,
right?
Rachel: Oh  Hi We just found
this cat and we're looking for the owner

exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry
Phoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard

Shelley: Hey gorgeous, how's it going?
Chandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights does it get
better than this?
Shelley: Question You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody
who would be perfect for you
Chandler: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem Had you said 'co-dependent', or
'self-destructive'
Shelley: Do you want a date Saturday?
Chandler: Yes please
Shelley: Okay He's cute, he's funny, he's-
Chandler: He's a he?

Chandler: Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that I mean, is that
ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Rachel: Um yeah Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe,
possibly, you might be 
Chandler: You did?
Rachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my
breasts, so then I figured maybe not
Chandler: Huh Did, uh any of the rest of you guys think that when you first
met me?
Monica: I did
Phoebe: Yeah, I think so, yeah
Joey: Not me
Ross: Nono, me neither Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor
did
Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Ross: No No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I
told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman who also liked her, so
Chandler: Well, this is fascinating So, uh, what is it about me?
Phoebe: I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny
Chandler: Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
All: Yeah! Right!
Chandler: WHAT IS IT?!
Monica: Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality
All: Yes Absolutely A quality

vague about this

Mrs Geller: Oh, maybe that's it
Monica: She is unbelievable, our mother is
Ross: Okay, relax, relax We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover
Monica: Oh God!
Monica: The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse 
Ross: Oh! Yeah, they were gross Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n'
Los How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants
Mr Geller: Not just restaurants, from our house
Nurse: Mrs Geller?
Ross: She looks so small 
Monica: I know
Ross: Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now 
Monica: G'bye, Nana 
Ross: Bye, Nana 
Monica: Ross!
Mrs Geller: What is going on?!
Ross: Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not,
quite

Aunt Lillian:  What's going on?
Mr Geller: She may have died
Aunt Lillian: She may have died?
Mr Geller: We're looking into it
Ross: I, uh, I'll go see 
Nurse: This almost never happens!
Ross: Now she's passed
Chandler: I just have to know, okay Is it my hair?
Rachel:  Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is It's your hair
Phoebe: Yeah, you have homosexual hair
Rachel: So, um, did she
Ross: Twice
Joey: Twice?
Phoebe: Oh, that sucks!
Joey: You guys okay?
Ross: I dunno, it's weird I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel,
uh
Phoebe: Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone
Ross: Nono, she's gone
Monica: We checked A lot
Phoebe: Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes Ever since my mom died, every
now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? 
 Oh! And
Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf
course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little
yellow pencils, y'know? I miss her
Rachel: Aw Hey, Pheebs, want this? 
Phoebe: Thanks!
Rachel: Sure I just sharpened her this morning
Joey: Now, see, I don't believe any of that I think once you're dead, you're
dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  So Chandler looks gay,
huh?
Phoebe: Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie 
Ross: I thought it was gonna be a closed casket
Mrs Geller: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
Mrs Geller: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Ross:  I don't see why not
Ross: Here's my retainer!

Monica: You what?
Mr Geller: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun 
Monica: Define fun
Mr Geller: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch
Monica: And then we throw your body in the water Gee, that does sound fun
Mr Geller: Everyone thinks they know me Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so
predictable' Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'
Monica: That's probably what they'll say
Mr Geller: I'd like that
Chandler: Hey, gorgeous
Shelley:  Hey Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
Chandler: No, nono, don't- don't worry about it Believe me, apparently other
people have made the same mistake
Shelley: Oh! Okay! Phew! 
Chandler: So, uh what do you think it is about me?
Shelley: I dunno, uh you just have a-a
Chandler: Quality, right, great

couple

Shelley: What? He's cute!
Chandler: Well, yeah 's'no Brian in Payroll
Shelley: Is Brian?
Chandler: No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with
someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him
Shelley: Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league
Chandler: Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get
a Brian Believe you me I'm really not
Ross:  This one?
Aunt Lillian: No
Ross: I have shown you everything we have Unless you want your mother to spend
eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy
Aunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong
one
Mrs Geller: You're right We'll go with the burgundy
Ross: Oh! A fine choice I'm coming out 
Aunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes!
Ross: Okay Um, how about these? 
Mrs Geller: That's really a day shoe
Ross: And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross:  Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy
I can show you something in a silver that may work
Aunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy
Mrs Geller: Mm Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross: No! Nonono, wait a sec I may have something in the back

Ross: Oh my God
Mrs Geller: Is everything all right, dear?
Ross: Yeah, just just Nana stuff

Chandler: You are a frightening, frightening man
Rachel: Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ross: Oh, I hope they're not ruined
Phoebe: God, what a great day What? Weather-wise!
Ross: I know, uh, the air, the-the trees even though Nana's gone there's,

Mr Geller: Beautiful! 
Rachel:  Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Mrs Geller:  Your grandmother would have hated this
Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all
Mrs Geller: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?',
I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting
your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'
Monica: That sounds like Nana
Mrs Geller: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?
Monica: I can imagine
Mrs Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the
positive, life-affirming person that she is
Monica: That is a wonder So tell me something, Mom If you had to do it all
over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Mrs Geller: Tell her what?
Monica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your
hair for example
Mrs Geller: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at
Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the
truth?
Mrs Geller: No I think some things are better left unsaid I think it's
nicer when people just get along 
Monica: Huh
Mrs Geller: More wine, dear?
Monica: Oh, I think so
Mrs Geller: 
Those earrings look really lovely on you
Monica: Thank you They're yours
Mrs Geller: Actually they were Nana's

Lowell: I know That's what I told her
Chandler: Really
Lowell: Yeah
Chandler: So- you can tell?
Lowell: Pretty much, most of the time We have a kind of radar
Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Lowell: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no By the way, your friend
Brian from Payroll, he is
Chandler: He is?
Lowell: Yup, and waaay out of your league 
Chandler: Out of my league I could get a Brian  If I
wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian  Hey, Brian

Rachel: Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was
wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Terry: An advance?
Rachel: It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family See, every year we
go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the
whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job
Terry: Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart You're a terrible, terrible waitress Really,
really awful

Tribbiani, man slash woman
Phoebe: What were you modeling for?
Joey: You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Monica: Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy

Monica: You know, they're not actually supposed to have 
 I'll work on the lumps Joey, you're going home, right?
Joey: Yeah

holidays
Chandler: Yes, every single one of them

do it 
Ross:  Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle A classic
Susan: Actually, I'm reading it to the baby
Ross: The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're
crazy?
Susan: What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
Ross: You're not serious, I mean, you really you really talk to it?
Susan: Yeah, all the time I want the baby to know my voice
Ross: Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Susan: Yeah, yeah, all the time
Ross: Really?
Susan: But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy
Ross: Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly
time too Not that I believe any of this
Phoebe: Oh, I believe it I think the baby can totally hear everything I can
show you Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey,
and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say
Chandler: I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment In fact,
I'd very much like to butter your head
Monica: Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Rachel: No, not even close Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop,
shoop, shoop
Monica: Rach, here's your mail
Rachel: Thanks, you can just put it on the table
Monica:  No, here's your mail

Rachel: Thank you Thank you so much!
Monica:  Chandler, here you go, got your traditional
Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family
size bag of Funyuns
Rachel: Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving
dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler: All right, I'm nine years old
Ross: Oh, I hate this story
Chandler: We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner I have--and I
remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents
choose to tell me they're getting divorced
Rachel: Oh my god
Chandler: Yes It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once
you've seen it in reverse
Joey: Uh, hi We uh, we used to work together
Girl: We did?
Joey: Yeah, at Macy's You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy
 Aramis? Aramis? 
Girl: Yeah, right
Joey: I gotta tell you You're the best in the business
Girl: Get out
Joey: I'm serious You're amazing You know when to spritz, when to lay back
Girl: Really? You don't know what that means to me
Joey: Ooh, you smell great tonight What're you wearing?
Girl:  Nothing
Joey: Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Girl: Yeah  Oh
Joey: What's wrong?
Girl: I just remembered, I have to do something
Joey: Oh What?
Girl: Um, leave
Joey: Wait, wait, wait!
Mario isn't telling youVD, you never know who might have it A variety of scenes are
Joey: So I guess you all saw it
Rachel: Saw what?
Phoebe: No, we were just laughing You know, how laughter can be infectious
Joey: Set another place for Thanksgiving My entire family thinks I have VD
Chandler: Tonight, on a very special Blossom
Monica: Mmm, looking good Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are
yamming  What?
Ross: I don't know It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen
Monica: All right, that's it You know what? Just get out of my way and stop
moping
Ross: That's closer
Rachel: I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop,
shoop
Chandler: Oh, you must stop shooping
Rachel: Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff
Joey: Chandler, will you just come in already?
Chandler: No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment
Phoebe: Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Chandler: Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not
funny anymore
Joey: Hey, Monica, I got a question I don't see any tater tots
Monica: That's not a question
Joey: But my mom always makes them It's like a tradition You get a little
piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't
be with my family because of my disease
Monica: All right, fine Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and
in the form of tots
Ross: Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child 
Monica: Ah!
Ross: Ok, Mom never hit
Phoebe:  Ok, all done
Monica: What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Phoebe: Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then
add some peas and onions
Monica: Why would we do that?
Phoebe: Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know,
before she died
Monica: Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up
Rachel: Ok, good-bye you guys Thanks for everything 
 Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Chandler: The most unbelievable thing has happened Underdog has just gotten
away
Joey: The balloon?
Chandler: No, no, the actual cartoon character Of course the balloon It's all
over the news Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Rachel: I can't, I gotta go
Chandler: Come on An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city How often
does that happen?
Phoebe: Almost never
Monica: Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Rachel: Ok
Carol: Anytime you're ready
Ross: Ok, ok, here we go  Ok, where am I
talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain
acoustical advantage, but
Carol: Just aim for the bump
Ross: Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes You know, I, you know, can't do this Uh, this
is too weird I feel stupid
Carol: So don't do it, it's fine You don't have to do it just because Susan
does it
Ross:  Hello, baby Hello, hello
Rachel: I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the
park
Phoebe: Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean
Monica: Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on
the inside Why are we standing here?
Rachel: We're waiting for you to open the door You got the keys
Monica: No I don't
Rachel: Yes, you do When we left, you said, "got the keys"
Monica: No I didn't I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Rachel: No, no, no, you said, "got the keys"
Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?
Monica:  The oven is on
Rachel: Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Joey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key
Monica: Well then get it, get it!
Joey: That tone will not make me go any faster
Monica:  Joey!
Joey: That one will 
Ross: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's
face it, you're a fetus You're just happy you don't have gills anymore
Carol: Look, you don't have to talk to it You can sing to it if you want
Ross: Oh, please I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Susan: Hi, how's it goin?
Ross: Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest
looks from, everyone we meet Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Carol: I did
Ross: Does it always, uh--?
Carol: No, no that was the first
Susan: Keep singing! Keep singing!
Ross:  Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you When
you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo
Susan: I felt it!
Ross:  Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts
Joey: Nope, not that one
Monica: Can you go any faster with that?
Joey: Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys You do the math
Monica: Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Chandler:  For an emergency just like this
Rachel:  All right, listen, smirky If it wasn't
for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this 
 right now But I'm not
Monica: I swear you said you had the keys
Rachel: No, I didn't I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I
obviously didn't have the keys
Phoebe: Ooh, ok, that's it Enough with the keys No one say keys
Monica: Why would I have the keys?
Rachel: Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Monica: But I didn't
Rachel: Well, you should have
Monica: Why?
Rachel: Because!
Monica: Why?
Rachel: Because!
Monica: Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm
making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of
potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes Does anybody care what kind of
potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned,
and, and I I
Chandler: Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open
Here we go
Monica: Well, the turkey's burnt  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes
are ruined, potatoes are ruined
Ross: Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's
Monica: No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? 
 Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one
Rachel: Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck
here with you guys
Joey: Hey, we all had better plans This was nobody's first choice
Monica: Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious
Thanksgiving dinner?
Joey: You call that delicious? 
Monica: Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Chandler: Now this feels like Thanksgiving
Phoebe: Ooh 
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven Oh my god He's not
alone Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal
Joey: I've gotta see this All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Monica: Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Phoebe: It's nice that he has someone
Chandler: Shall I carve?
Rachel: By all means
Chandler: Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
Ross: I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese
Monica:  Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Joey: Oh, I will
Phoebe: Ooh, you guys have to make a wish
Monica: Make a wish?
Phoebe: Come on, you know, Thanksgiving Ooh, you got the bigger half What'd
you wish for?
Joey: The bigger half
Chandler: I'd like to propose a toast Little toast here, ding ding I know this
isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been
really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with
your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings
sucked
All: That's so sweet
Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas
Rachel: And a crappy New Year
Chandler: Here, here!

All: Oooh!
Monica: W-wait What is that?
Ross: 'That' would be Marcel You wanna say hi?
Monica: No, no, I don't
Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab
Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Ross: Yeah I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so
Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross: Nah, I dunno I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is
kinda pathe-  sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really
cool way to live'
Phoebe: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight I have twelve new songs
about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman
Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman
All: Hey, Joey Hey, buddy
Monica: So, how'd it go?
Joey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job
Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year
Joey: I dunno Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager He's not even
jolly, it's all political
Monica: So what are you gonna be?
Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers It's just such a slap in the face,
y'know?
Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? 
 Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can
have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so
I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you 
Phoebe: Yeah, you wish!
Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday
I say this year, no dates, we make a pact Just the six of us- dinner
All: Yeah, okay Alright
Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm 
All: Woooo! Yeah!
Rachel: Phoebe, you're on
Phoebe: Oh, oh, good
Rachel:  Okay, hi Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular
demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay Wooh!
Phoebe:  Thanks, hi Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot
to me this time of year   
  I made a man with eyes of coal
  And a smile so bewitchin',
  How was I supposed to know
  That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
   La lalala la la la la lalala la la
Phoebe:  
  My mother's ashes
  Even her eyelashes
  Are resting in a little yellow jar,
  And sometimes when it's breezy
Phoebe:  
  I feel a little sneezy
  And now I-  
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys!  Is
it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
Max: No No, that's- that's okay
Phoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then
I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Chandler:  That guy's going home with a note!
David: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Phoebe: Could you speak up please?
David:  Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my
friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my
life And then he said that- you said you thought
Max: Daryl Hannah
David: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life
and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I
thought she had kind of a 
Max: Hard quality
David: -hard quality And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional
way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace Then, uh, that-that-that's when you
started yelling 
Phoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break 
Joey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Ross: Come here, Marcel Sit here 
Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet I mean God, by my
sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! Ooh Did I just
share too much?
Ross: Just a smidge
Phoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy He's very methodical
Monica: I think it's romantic
Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Rachel: Yeah!
Phoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with Except, except
he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter I just- I just wanna be with him all the
time Day and night, and night and day and special occasions 
Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna
ask him to New Year's, aren't you You're gonna break the pact She's gonna break the
pact
Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no Yeah, could I just?
Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice
Monica: What?!
Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
Chandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped
Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Joey: Hi Hi, sorry I'm late
Chandler: Too many jokes must mock Joey! 
Joey: Nice shoes, huh? 
Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!
Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?
Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone Alright? We- we had our first fight this
morning I think it has to do with my working late I said some things that I didn't mean,
and he- he threw some faeces
Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you
Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're
there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me
Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie
David: But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle
accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
Phoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then 
David: Yuh
Phoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
David: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question And, uh, the answer would be
 yes Yes I was But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss
that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you
Phoebe: Sure
David: Right But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to
be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I
just like sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it And, uh, I'm not
really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella
Phoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella I mean, you're a
sweeper! trapped inside a physicist's body
David: Rrrreally
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it You should just do it, just sweep and
throw me 
David: Now? Now?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, right now
David: Okay, okay, okay 
 Y'know what, this was just really expensive 
 And I'll take- this was a gift 
Phoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying 
David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell 
 You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Phoebe: I can hop 
Ross: So tell me something What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Monica: I'm sorry, okay It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has
somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby
Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Monica: Yeah
Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob
Rachel:  Okay, here we go

Monica: What's the matter?
Ross: Oh, it's-it's Marcel He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking
around all the time dragging his hands

Ross: Really
Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV that juggling thing is amazing
Ross: What, uh what juggling thing?
Chandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that
Ross: No
Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal He just balled up socks and a
melon
Max: Phoebe Hi

Monica: That thing is not coming in here
Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you
something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your
home?
Monica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table
Ross: Okay He was more embarrassed about that than anyone Okay? And for him to
have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened
Monica: Alright Just keep him away from me
Ross: Thank you  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a
little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh catch up with you later

cab first And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my
hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm
going to get into a cab she tackles me And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my
whistleoheverybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?

and realise I have a bomb?"
Ross: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna

Rachel: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've
ever had
Phoebe: Which proves that I never lie
Rachel: I guess you don't
Phoebe: Paolo made a pass at me
Chandler: So, what do you think?
Ross: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen
Chandler: I know!
Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little
guys' heads?
Joey: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Monica: Heads up Ross!  Score! 
 You suck!
Phoebe: Are you okay?
Rachel: I need some milk
Phoebe: Ok, I've got milk 
Here you go  Oh! Better?
Rachel: Nooh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other
day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel
so" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
Phoebe: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
Rachel: Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Rachel and Phoebe: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No
I'm sorry! 
Phoebe: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
Rachel: I don't knowright, he's the pig!
Phoebe: Such a pig!
Rachel: Oh, God, he's such a pig, 
Phoebe: Oh he's like a
Rachel: He's like a big disgusting 
Phoebe: like a
Rachel: pigpig man!
Phoebe: Yes, good! Ok
Rachel:  Oh, but he was my pig manhow did I not see this?
Phoebe:  Oh! I know!  It's because he's
gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you
Rachel: Ok, Ok, Pheebs
Phoebe: The end
Rachel: Oh, God
Phoebe: Should I not have told you?
Rachel: No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know Uh, I just
liked it better before it was better
Phoebe: I think she took it pretty well You know Paolo's over there right now,
so
Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay 
 Just onesecond! Score!  Game!
Come on 
Ross:  Ahooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your
butts
Joey: No-no, she kicked our butts You could be on the Olympic standing-there
team
Ross: Come on, two on one
Chandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's
time for you to swoop in!
Ross: What, now?
Joey: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out
of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's
not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Chandler: My Catholic friend is right She's distraught You're there for her
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! 
Paolo: No, that's cold, that's cold, that's
Ross:  How's it going?
Monica: Don't stare Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony,
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, 
, Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous
breasts!" Here he comes! 
Phoebe: Ooh!
Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye
Phoebe: Oh, ok bye-bye
Monica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, 
 but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles
Paolo: Grazie
Ross: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I
say 
Phoebe: Oh, just look at her 
Ross: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's
not overwhelmed
Monica: Oh, you're right
Ross:  and I really think it should be me
Ross: Hey
Rachel: Hey
Ross: You all right?
Rachel: Ooh, I've been better
Ross: Come here  Listen, you deserve so much better than
himyou know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he
has you
Rachel: Oh, Ross
Ross: What?
Rachel: I am so sick of guys I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want
to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy 
Ross: Huh
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ross: Ohhhh 
Monica: Oohhey honey, are you all right?
Rachel: Oh
Phoebe: You ok?
Rachel: mediumhmmany cookies left?
Phoebe: Yep!
Ross: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the
answer I really don't I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated
screening process
Rachel: No I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to
figure out what I want
Ross: Uh, no, no, see, because notnot all guys are going to be a Paolo
Rachel: No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up
to be one
Ross:  What? 
Rachel: What?
Ross: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Rachel: Uhno No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy
Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?
Girls: Yes, you're having a boy! 
Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Chandler: Wha-
Joey: Wha-

Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! 
Ross: I'm having a son Um
Monica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!! 
Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!

fridge Then Rachel comes out of the shower with a towel wrapped round her waist, drying
herself with another towel Chandler and Rachel startle each other and she drops the towel
Rachel: That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
Chandler: I'm sorry!
Rachel: You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Chandler: Rachel, wait, wait
Rachel: No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
Chandler: Can I just say one thing?
Rachel: What? What?!
Chandler: That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your nipular
areas
Rachel: Oh!!
Phoebe: Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks
things are, like, other things Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower
Roger: That's pretty much it
Phoebe: Oops!
Roger: But you tell it really well, sweetie
Phoebe: Thanks Okay, now go away so we can talk about you
Roger: Okay I'll miss you
Phoebe: Isn't he great?
Rachel: He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much
Phoebe: I know, I know So sweet and so complicated And for a shrink, he's
not too shrinky, y'know?
Monica: So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know I think that's a little weird, y'know?
Vinyl
Rachel: Okaaay  Any of you guys want anything else?
Chandler: Oh, yes, could I have one of those 
Rachel: No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those Anybody else?
Chandler: Okay
Roger: Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Chandler: No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies
Ross: You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Chandler: It was an accident Not like I was across the street with a telescope
and a box of donuts
Rachel: Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts
Rachel: Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change
Chandler: Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice
boobies
Rachel: Nice? They were nice I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice
Chandler: Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me
Roger: You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when
the laughter stops
Chandler: Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky What'd you mean by that?
Roger: Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues Y'know,
that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance
Chandler: Huh
Roger: I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam Only child,
right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty
Chandler: Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Roger: It's textbook
Joey: Hey you guys Hey, you all know my dad, right?
All: Hey! Hey, Mr Trib!
Monica: Hey, how long are you in the city?
Mr Tribbiani: Just for a coupla days I got a job midtown I figure I'm better
off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry  I
don't know this one
Phoebe: Oh, this is my friend Roger
Roger: Hi 
Mr Tribbiani: Hey, hey Good to meet you, Roger
Roger: You too, sir
Mr Tribbiani:  What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Joey: Dad, dad 
Mr Tribbiani: Oh, 'scuse me So Ross, uh, how's the wife? 
 Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something
funny!
Mr Tribbiani: Gotta go I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late
now
Joey:  Hey Ma Listen, I made the appointment with Dr
Bazida, and Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
Mr Tribbiani: Her name's Ronni She's a pet mortician 
Joey: Sure So how long you been 
Mr Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the
navy yard and show you the big ships?
Joey: Since then?!
Mr Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years I just wanted to put a nice memory
in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy Joe Y'ever been
in love?
Joey: I d'know
Mr Tribbiani: Then y'haven't You're burning your tomatoes
Joey: You're one to talk 
Mr Tribbiani: Joe, your dad's in love big time And the worst part of it is,
it's with two different women
Joey: Oh man Please tell me one of 'em is Ma
Mr Tribbiani: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma What's the matter with you
Joey: It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this
double life He's like actually some spy, working for the CIA  That'd be
cool This blows!
Rachel: I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? 
 Why do they have to become
people? Why do they have  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Chandler:  What?  What?
Rachel: Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Ross: Alright, alright We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve
this Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee
Chandler: Y'know, I don't see that happening?
Rachel: C'mon, he's right Tit for tat
Chandler: Well I'm not showing you my 'tat'
Monica: Hello?
Phoebe:  It's Phoebe
Roger:  And Rog
Monica: C'mon up
Chandler:  Oh, good Rog is here
Joey: What's the matter with Rog?
Ross: Yeah
Chandler: Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing I hate that guy
Ross: What, so he was a little analytical That's what he does, y'know? C'mon,
he's not that bad
Ross: Y'see, that's where you're wrong Why would I marry her if I thought on
any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Roger: I dunno Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail
Ross: Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Roger: I don't know Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for
overshadowing a sibling, maybe you
Monica: Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing
Roger: Well, I don't know I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage
your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents
Ross: That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Monica: Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Phoebe: Isn't he good?
Ross: Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying
Monica: Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side But maybe what
you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Ross: Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Rachel: You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it
was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship Oh, which had this little
lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in 
Roger: That's tough Tough stuff C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta get going 
Phoebe: Oh, okay Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
Roger: Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie
Phoebe: Oh, okay Listen, thanks for everything, Mon
Monica: You're welcome
Roger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again Mon, um, easy on those
cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love
Monica: Hate that guy! 
Joey: Night, you guys
Chandler: Oh look, it's the woman we ordered
Joey: Hey Can, uh, can we help you?
Ronni: Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani
Joey: I'm Joey Tribbiani
Ronni: Oh no, not you, big Joey Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your
pictures!  I-I'm, I'm RonniCheese Nip?
Chandler: Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Ronni: Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta
laid out like they're sleeping But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a
pose Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee
Chandler: Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys
Ronni: That's a good one!
Mr Tribbiani: Hey, Joe
Joey: Dad, Ronni's here
Mr Tribbiani: Huh?
Ronni: Hi

Ronni: Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss
the last train
Mr Tribbiani: I don't want you taking that thing
Ronni: Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Joey: Who-ah-ho

Ronni:  We'll go to a hotel
Joey: No you won't
Ronni: No we won't
Joey: If you go to a hotel you'll bedoing stuff I want you right here where
I can keep an eye on you
Mr Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Joey: That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're
under my roof you're gonna live by my rules And that means no sleeping with your
girlfriend
Ronni: Wow He's strict
Joey: Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room
Ronni: Thanks You're, uh, you're a good kid
Chandler: C'mon, I'll show you to my room That sounds so weird when it's not
followed by "No thanks, it's late" 
Joey: Okay Now this is just for tonight Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a
change This has gone on long enough
Mr Tribbiani: What kinda change?
Joey: Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Mr Tribbiani: I can't do that!
Joey: Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Mr Tribbiani: Yeah, but this is
Joey: I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Chandler: Hey, Kicky What're you doing?
Joey: Just trying to get comfortable I can't sleep in my underwear 
Chandler: Well, you're gonna
Joey: I've been thinking Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of
girls
Chandler: Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Joey: Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and
go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking
Chandler: Hey, you're not him You're you When they were all over you to go
into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Joey: No
Chandler: No You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business Now that
wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes
along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married"
Joey: You really think so?
Chandler: Yeah I really do
Joey: Thanks, Chandler 
Chandler: Get off!
Ronni: Hi
Monica: HiMay I help you?
Ronni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in
ours?
Monica: Okaywho are you?
Ronni: Oh, I'm Ronni Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Monica: Oh, c'mon in
Ronni: Thanks
Rachel: Hi, I'm Rachel
Ronni: Hi
Rachel: Bathroom's up there
Ronni: Great
Rachel: Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the
shower?
Ronni: Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
Rachel: Perfect Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time 
 Hey, Mr Trib 
Mr Tribbiani: Hey Morning, dear
Rachel: Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing
Joey:  What's the matter with you?!
Rachel: I thought it was Chandler!
Chandler:  What? What?
Rachel: You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Chandler: Sorry, my my thing was in there with me
All: Hey, Pheebs
Phoebe: Hey 
Monica: How's it going?
Phoebe: Good Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite
you guys
Phoebe: So what's going on?
Monica: Nothing, um, it's just, um It's Roger 
Ross: I dunno, there's just something about
Chandler: Basically we just feel that he's
Rachel: We hate that guy
All: Yeah Hate him
Ross: We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry
Phoebe: Uh-huh Okay Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's
so perceptive that it freaks you out?
All: No, we hate him
Rachel: We're sorry
Joey: Ma! What're you doing here?
Mrs Tribbiani: I came to give you this  and this
Joey: Oww! Big ring!
Mrs Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that
garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in
there, put it away For God's sake, Joey, really 
Joey: Hold on, you-you knew?
Mrs Tribbiani: Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James
Bond You should've heard some of his cover stories "I'm sleeping over at my
accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
Joey: So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
Mrs Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling,
always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not
those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he
has a hobby
Joey: Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but what the hell are you talking
about?! I mean, what about you?
Mrs Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her,
and your father would look like Sting And I'll tell you something else Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive,
he's been more loving I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary
Joey: I'mhappyfor you?
Mrs Tribbiani: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up I just want
it the way it was
Joey: Ma, I'm sorry I just did what I thought you'd want
Mrs Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie Oh, I know you did So tell me Did you
see her?
Joey: Yeah You're ten times prettier than she is
Mrs Tribbiani: That's sweet Could I take her?
Joey: With this ring?  No contest
Roger: What's wrong, sweetie?
Phoebe: Nothing, nothing
Roger: Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon 
Phoebe: It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine It's my friends They-they have a
liking problem with you In that, um, they don't
Roger: Oh They don't
Phoebe: But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see They don't see all
the good stuff and all the sweet stuff They just think you're a little
Roger: What?
Phoebe: Intense and creepy 
Roger: Oh
Phoebe: But I don't Me, Phoebe
Roger: Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way
Phoebe: You're not? See, that's why you're so great! 
Roger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this
kind of dysfunctional group dynamic Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally
stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry,
might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love
me, I need love!'
Monica: So you talked to your dad, huh
Joey: Yeah He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep
pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her
husband any more because he got a restraining orderwhich has nothing to do with
anything except that I found out today
Rachel: Wow
Chandler: Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain
Ross: So Joey, you okay?
Joey: Yeah, I guess It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go
Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes
Rachel: Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them
Chandler: If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing
after twenty-year-old boys, or I'll end up like my mom
Phoebe:  Hey
All: Hey, Pheebs
Monica: How's it going?
Phoebe: Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger
All: Awww
Phoebe: Yeah, right
All: Aaawwwwww!!
Rachel: What happened?
Phoebe: I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet,
and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just I hate that guy!
Phoebe: Hey, Joey What's going on?
Joey: Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express Next stop: Rachel Green
Monica: Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Joey: Sorry Wrong boobies
Monica: Hello, Joey
Mr Tribbiani: Oh! Hello, dear

Ross: An egg?

Joey: Think it'll work?
Chandler: No, it's suicide The man's got an egg
Monica: You can not do this
Rachel: Do what, do what?
Monica: Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night
Rachel: No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Phoebe: 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening alright,
still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Monica: But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year I
know I do 
Rachel: Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey: Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes
Chandler: Oh, uh, listen, about tonight
Joey: No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me The only reason she's goin' out
with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend
Chandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a
Joey: Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's
vulnerable I'm thinkin', cha-ching! 
 Thanks Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice You're doin'
this
Ross: Hi She said yes
Chandler: Yes! Way to go, man! 
 Still got the egg, huh?
Joey:  How do I look?

Joey: No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with
Lorraine Just calm down 
Chandler: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped
twice in the last five months!
Joey:  Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I
can't go when I'm nervous
Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right 
 Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
Rachel: Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney
Monica: Which one was Pete Carney?
Rachel: Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had
sex  "Was it good for you?"
Monica: Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over
Howard-the-"I-win"-guy  "I win! I win!" I went out with
the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once
Rachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica: I don't know Maybe we're some kinda magnets
Phoebe: I know I am That's why I can't wear a digital watch
Monica: There's more beer, right?
Phoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you
want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual
Rachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald
Phoebe: Yeah So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys It's Valentine's Day
It's perfect
Monica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Phoebe: Ok We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us
Rachel: Or?
Phoebe: Oror we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks
Monica: Burning's good
Rachel: Burning's good Yeah, I got stuff to burn
Lorraine are seated very close, Chandler and Janice have backed their chairs away from one

Chandler: So I quit
All: Why?
Chandler: Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Monica: Yeah, Chandler you've been there for five years

Chandler: It doesn't matter I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in
his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS

museum

back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey
Chandler: And he's not speaking metaphorically
Joey:  So back to your placeyou thinking, maybe
 huh-huh?
Ross: Well, I don't know  huh-huh but I'm hoping

Joey: I don't know We're talking about whipped fish, Monica I'm just happy I'm
keeping it down, y'know?
Rachel: My God! What happened to you?

personality tests and what do I learn?  "You
are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational
corporation"
Phoebe: That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be
doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing
somethingsomething
Rachel:  Oh Chandler, I know, I know oh,
hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Monica:  Here you go, maybe this'll
cheer you up
Chandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split
this with you

Joey: Uh-oh
Monica: Well of course I thought of you! But but
Rachel: But, but?
Monica: But, you see, it's just this night has to go just perfect, you know?
And, well, Wendy's more of a professional waitress
Rachel: Oh! I see And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I
can waitress in the Olympics
Chandler: You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in
'76  Amouz-bouche?

Ross: Shut up! It was nice I just I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind

can really care about  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you
mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is
not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm

he uh, mentioned the word frenzy
Mr Douglas: Youre kidding? She seems so
Chandler: Oh, no, no Nina  she is
whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no
recollection of being fired at all, none at all
Mr Douglas: Thats unbelievable
Chandler: And yet, believable So I decided not to fire her again until I can be
assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others
Mr Douglas: I see I guess you never really know whats goin on inside
a persons head
Chandler: Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir

Mr Geller: I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of
this sun-dried tomato business Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a
tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
Ross: Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Mr Geller: I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had
come to me with the idea andndash;
Ross: Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing Did you uh,
ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a
thing?
Mr Geller: No Your mother really did the work I was busy with the
business I wasn't around that much Is that what this is about?
Ross: No, no, Dad, I was just wondering
Mr Geller: 'Cause there's time to make up for that We can do stuff
together You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg How 'bout we do that?
Ross: Thanks, Dad, really, I ju you know, I just, I just needed to know,
um when did you start to feel like a father?
Mr Geller: Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were
born We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and
gave you to me You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my
finger with your whole fist And you squeezed it, so tight And that's when I knew
Mr Geller: So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Ross: No, we can go to Williamsburg
Mr Geller: Eat your fish

Monica: It will not be fine We'll get in trouble
Rachel: Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica: A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?

Dr Rosen: So, Monica, what do you do?
Rachel:  Aahh, I'm a chef at a restaurant uptown

Rachel: Would you excuse me for a second?
Monica:  Remember back in freshman year? 
 Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed
she staggers backwards, eyes agog, gasping for breath, and literally not knowing which way
to turn Finally, she escapes into the bathroom while a resigned Dr Mitchell looks
philosophically at Dr Rosen who seems about remind him of the good old days at the pagan
round the coffee table, playing Scrabble Rachel, still in her dressing gown, is pleading
Rachel:  Daddy Daddy Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy
Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business!

Rachel: I know, I know, I'm sorry-
Ross: No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault Y'know, I shouldn't've,
uh, asked you to start off with a monkey I should've started you off with like a pen or a
pencil
Rachel:  Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody
looking for him, and I-  Oh! Who is it?
Intercom: Animal Control
Rachel: See? I've even called Animal Control!
Ross: You called Animal Control?
Rachel: Uh-huh why do you not like them?
Ross: Marcel is an illegal exotic animal I'm not allowed to
have him in the city If they find him, they'll take him away from me
Rachel: O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that
Ross: That's right, I 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the
apartment!
Rachel: Hi, thanks for coming
Luisa:  Somebody called about a monkey?

Ross: Cat!
Rachel: Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Monica: Hi We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel
Luisa: Marcel?
Ross: My uncle Marcel
Phoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Luisa: Oookay Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh,
punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Phoebe: Oh my God You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Monica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to
yourself first?

Monica: The Luisa from home room!
Rachel: Yes!!
Luisa: You have no idea who I am, do you
Monica: No, none at all

would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
Monica: Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems 
 But you? What a bitch!

queen and the class president and you were also there! But if you take this monkey, I
will lose one of the most important people in my life You can hate me if you want, but
please do not punish him C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!
Take it!
Luisa: Nope
Rachel: Alright Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that
you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Ross: It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will 
 Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine
Rachel: Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little
outfit

Ross: Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great
Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine You in the mood for, uh,
something grape?
Rachel: That'd be good
Ross: Alright 
 The, uh, the neighbours must be
vacuuming  Well, so long as we're here and, uh,
not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and,
um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um
Barry: Rachel
Rachel: Barry?!
Barry: I can't I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy I think I'm still
in love with you
Ross and Rachel: Oh!

Monica: This is me in The Sound of Music See the von Trapp kids?
Phoebe: Nope
Monica: That's because I'm in front of them
Chandler: Eh I thought that was an alp
Monica: Well, high school was not my favourite time
Joey: I dunno, I loved high school Y'know? It was just four years of parties
and dating and sex
Chandler: Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys Any sex I
had would've involved a major lifestyle choice
Monica: Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Phoebe: Oh Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My
butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
s01e20
Chandler: I can't believe you would actually say that I would much
rather be MrPeanut than MrSalty
Joey: No way! MrSalty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest
snack there is
Ross: I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts They're craaazy
Monica:  Oh my God You guys! You gotta come see
this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Ross: I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Rachel: Oh, that is so sick
Chandler: I feel violated And not in a good way
Phoebe: How can people do that? 
 Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Chandler: I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one
of the greatest first dates of all time It was unbelievable! We could totally be
ourselves, we didn't have to play any games
Monica: So have you called her yet?
Chandler: Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? 
 It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm
right, right?
Joey and Ross: Oh, yeah Yeah Let her dangle
Monica: I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you
people
Phoebe: Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so
testosteroney!
Chandler: Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat 
 I got her machine
Joey: Her answer machine?
Chandler: No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up
Phoebe: So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up
using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o"
Monica: Look look! It's Rachel and Barry No, don't everybody look at once!
Ross: Okay, okay, what's going on?
Phoebe: Okay, they're just talking
Ross: Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to
shove anything?
Phoebe: No, no actually, he's smiling and Oh my God, don't do that!!
Ross: What? What? What?!
Phoebe: That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!
Chandler:  And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law
All: Oh! Right!
Chandler: Hey Rach!
Monica: How'd it go?
Rachel: Y'know, it was, uh it was actually really great He took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all
the butter squirts out
Phoebe: Not a good day for birds
Rachel: Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to,
but he got me a little bottle of Chanel
Ross: That's nice now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling,
stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Rachel: Right, well, we never actually got to that Oh, it was just so
nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar it was just nice!
Ross: That's, that's nice twice!
Monica: Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left
at the altar?
Joey: Duh, where've you been?
Rachel: Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Chandler: Yes!
Rachel: Why?
Chandler: I have my reasons
Monica: Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just
happens to be your ex-best friend?
Rachel: All right All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's
stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Rachel: Wow Wow!
Barry: Yeah
Rachel: I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that
Barry: Nooo, it wasn't
Rachel: Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here
Chandler:  Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the
machine Give me a call when you get a chance  Bye-bye 
 Oh God!
Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two
hours?!
Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
Ross: What was with the dishes?
Chandler: Oh, uh I want her to think I might be in a restaurant y'know? I
might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past
few hours
Monica:  Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with
the telescope!
Phoebe: Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in
here!
Monica: Great, now he's waving back
Joey: Man, we gotta do something about that guy This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica: What kinda stuff?
Joey: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm
cooking naked
Phoebe: You cook naked?
Joey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal nothing that spatters
Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that
Barry: What's the matter?
Rachel: Oh, it's just Oh, Barry, this was not good
Barry: No, it was It was very very good
Rachel: Well, what about Mindy?

starting to see some real progress here
Rachel: What?!
Bobby: I'm twelve, I'm not stupid
Chandler: Can I use your phone?
Monica: Yeah uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be
used as a phone
Chandler: Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey: Maybe she never got your message
Phoebe: Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of
beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet
Chandler: Y'don't think that makes me seem a little
Ross: desperate, needy, pathetic?
Chandler: Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad
Phoebe: How many beeps?
Chandler: She answered
Monica: Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about
Chandler: I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is
choosing not to call me Now I'm needy and snubbed God, I miss just being needy
All: Hey! Hi!
Phoebe: How'd he take it?
Rachel: Pretty well, actually 
Monica:  Uh, Rach how come you have dental floss in
your hair?

Rachel: Please If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right
here, right now," what would you say? 
Chandler: If it helps, I could slide over
Ross: It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and
oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go
Phoebe: Where are you going?

Mindy: Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really
weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel

was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too
Mindy: Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!

Mindy: Okay, okay when Barry was engaged to you, he and Ikind of had a
little thing on the side

Rachel: Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Barry: Mindy Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy

Barry:  I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you
Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a
lineup!
Mindy:  You did it twice?

Rachel: Okay Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating
when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump
right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great
Mindy: Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him
Rachel: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in
a smock!
Mindy: Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I
still really wanna be Mrs Dr Barry Farber, DDS
Rachel: Oh God 
Mindy: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me And I hope you'll still
be my maid of honor?
Rachel: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba

wondered whether I made the right choice And now I know

Danielle:  Chandler?
Chandler: Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody
All: Hi Hi
Chandler: What are you doing here?
Danielle: Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your
number wrong And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer
So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay
Chandler: I'm, I'm okay
Danielle: Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?
Chandler: That sounds good I'll call you- or you call me, whatever

her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean, how needy is that?
s01e21
Joey: How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica: I have no idea But look how much they spent!
Rachel: Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only
have to pay for the stuff that you bought
Monica: I know It's just such reckless spending
Ross: I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind
Chandler: Wow, what a geek They spent $6995 on a Wonder Mop
Monica: That's me
Phoebe: Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! 
Ross: Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-
 come here, Marcel-
Rachel: Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him
Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping
Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase
Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey
Ross: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal
Rachel:  Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross: What?
Rachel: Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious
Rachel: Oh, Monica You are not still going over that thing
Monica: This woman's living my life
Rachel: What?
Monica: She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this,
look She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see She, she buys clothes from stores that
I'm intimidated by the sales people She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies
Rachel: You're not an artist
Monica: Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this
stuff Only I don't
Rachel: Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things
Monica: Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we
Rachel:  Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'
Monica: Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New
School?
Rachel:  Nooo
Monica: This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my
mother
Chandler: How about Joey Pepponi?
Joey: No, still too ethnic My agent thinks I should have a name that's more
neutral
Chandler: Joey Switzerland?
Joey: Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe Y'know, Joey makes me sound like
I'm, I dunno, this big  Which I'm not
Chandler: JoeJoeJoeStalin?

Rachel: What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit

Monica: This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is
Rachel: Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! Okay, Monica,
y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a
weird obsession thing
Phoebe: This is madness It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God,
Monica, don't do it!! Thank you
Monica: What d'you think?
Phoebe: Lotsa things
Rachel: Which one do you think she is?
Teacher: May I help you?

containers lying around after class Let's not have that happen again!

uncoordinated?
Rachel: What? You just click when they click
Teacher: Alright people, now everyone grab a partner
Phoebe: Okay And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it I'm with Rachel

Ross:  Hi
Chandler and Joey: Hey
Joey: Where've you been?
Ross: At the vet
Chandler: She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Ross: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase Apparently he's reached
sexual maturity
Joey:  Hey! He beat ya
Ross: She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent
Chandler: So what does this mean?
Ross: I'm gonna have to give him up
Joey: I can't believe it, Ross This sucks!
Chandler: I don't get it, I mean, you just got him How can he be an adult
already?
Ross: I know I know I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you
know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg
Joey: Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross: No, no The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to
some monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious I've just gotta get him into a zoo
Joey: How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler: I know that one! No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen
Ross: Well, we're applying to a lot of them Naturally our first choice would be
one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego right? But that might just be
a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility
Chandler: Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach I mean, it's a
total party zoo
Phoebe: Hey We found her, we found the girl
Chandler: What?
Joey: Did you call the cops?
Rachel: Nope We took her to lunch
Chandler: Ah Your own brand of vigilante justice
Ross: What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you She stole She's a
stealer
Monica: Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you
forget all that I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing
spirit
Ross: Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader
Chandler: Take off their hats!
Phoebe: Popes in a Volkswagen! I love that joke
Rachel: No way No way did you do this
Fake Monica: Monana was very brave
Monica: It was so wild We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen
Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica: So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and
have breasts
Monica: They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel: Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream I
get to go pour coffee for people I don't know Don't wait up 
Fake Monica: Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show
Monica: 'Scuse me?
Fake Monica: There's an open call for Cats I'm thinking we go down there, sing
Memories and make complete fools of ourselves Whaddya say?
Monica: Nononononono Think who you're dealing with here I mean, I'm not like
you I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class
Fake Monica: Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background
Monica: What?
Fake Monica: Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica: Right Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned
Fake Monica: I-I used to be just like you And then one day I saw a movie that
changed my life Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica: Uh-huh
Fake Monica: I thought that movie was so incredibly boring
I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?
What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre I
walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never
getting back' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do
Monica: Wow Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs Doubtfire
Ross:  Oh God  We didn't get into Scranton 
 That was like our safety zoo They take like dogs and cows See? I don't know who
this is harder on, me or him
Phoebe: I'd say that chair's taking the brunt
Ross: Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy See, how can nobody want him?
Rachel: Oh, somebody will
Joey:  You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler: You're kidding
Joey: Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people
You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler: Y'know, you'd think I would've
Joey: Phoebe Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe: Flame Boy
Ross: Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr Baldhara: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an
interactive wildlife experience Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross: Yes
Dr Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross: No-no, he's, he's very docile
Dr Baldhara: Even if he were cornered?
Ross: Well I, I don't know Why?
Dr Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross: He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean
Dr Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross: Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,
you've got to give the little guy something Otherwise it's just cruel
Chandler and Joey: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San
Diego
Joey: We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing
Chandler: He's in
Ross: He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego San Diego!
Dr Baldhara: You're making a big mistake here I mean, San Diego's all well and
good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you
twenty percent of the gains

Monica: I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Rachel: No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something
about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just : W-well, what else
did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Joey: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't
mind getting a cup of coffee or something

Chandler:  H-He's in China!
Joey: The country
Monica: No, no, wait  His flight doesn't leave for

Monica: Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel: I-I-I don't know

ever met I mean you're practically a woman
Monica: Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean,
it's only a little bit torn so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw
it out?

I thought about it all the way back and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross
Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross
Monica and Phoebe: Sure
Rachel: I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling but I'm
thinking oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great
Monica: Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the
best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's
like starting on the fifteenth date!
Phoebe: Yeah, but, y'know, it's it would be like starting on the fifteenth
date
Monica: Another good point
Phoebe: No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're
already in a very relationshippy place Y'know, it's you're committed
Rachel:  Huh?
Phoebe: Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica: Why isn't it working out?
Rachel: I don't know sometimes it doesn't

Phoebe: Maybe there's someone else
Rachel: Wha
Monica: Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel: No! There is there is noone else!
Monica: Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Chandler: Hey, big
Joey: Shhhh!
Chandler:  spender
Joey: She's still asleep
Chandler: So how'd it go?
Joey: Oh, it was amazing You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler: The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know
me
Joey: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me
great So I had to do all this other stuff And the response I got man, oh man, it was
like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler: Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade
route
Joey: It was amazing! And not just for her uh-uh For me, too It's like, all
of a sudden, I'm blind But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like I was
able to appreciate it on another level
Chandler: I didn't know you had another level
Joey: I know! Neither did I!
Monica: Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Rachel: Yeah
Monica: Oh, from who?
Rachel: From you I exchanged the blouse you got me
Monica: Well, it's the thought Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple
hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel: Uh, yeah Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and
I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea
Monica: Oh, why?
Rachel: Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him I would be
going out with all of you Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't
wanna
Monica:  No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Rachel: Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so
Monica: I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but I'll be
good I promise
Rachel: Who is it?
Intercom: It's me, Carl
Rachel: C'mon up
Monica: Behind my brother's back?   is exactly the kind
of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me
Joey: Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler: Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Joey: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I
learned something
Chandler: Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Joey: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk
around like this? 
Carl: I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr in that stupid
electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong I'm not against
environmental issues per se it's just that guy!
Ross: I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me
Rachel: Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here
Ross: Fine, just stop thinking about me
Ross: Can't do it, can you?
Rachel: So I'm thinking about you So what?
Ross: I don't get it What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rachel: Well he happens to be a very nice guy
Carl: I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Ross: Rachel, come on Give us a chance
Rachel: Ross, it's too hard
Ross: No, no, no why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares
about them This is about us Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth
grade 
Rachel: Ross, you're like my best friend
Ross: I know
Rachel: If we broke up, and I lost you
Ross: Whoa, whoa, whoa What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel: Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross:  No But it only has to happen once Look, you and I both
know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean so, the only question is are you
attracted to me?
Rachel: I don't know I mean, I've never looked at you that way before
Ross: Well, start looking 
Rachel: Wow
Carl: Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this
hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel: Right! You're right!
Carl: Heh y'know?

Carl: What?
Rachel: I forgot I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport I am so
